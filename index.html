  <p>I started my journey at Lambda School after talking to my husband about what I want to do when I decide to go back to work after being a stay-at-home mom for a few years. Before having my daughter, I had done nothing but office admin work since graduating college in 2012. I have a BA in Journalism from Angelo State University but have not been able to do anything with it. I knew when I was ready to go back to work, I didn't just want a job; I wanted a career! Joining Lambda's Web Development program has been the best decison I have made in my professional career. I'm learning to code and how to develop websites which is something I have always wanted to learn how to do. As I continue this journey, I expect this portfoli site to grow and develop as much as I will in this program. I can't wait to see where this adventure takes me next. </p>
